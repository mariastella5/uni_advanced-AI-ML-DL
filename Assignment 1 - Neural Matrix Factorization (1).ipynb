    "So far we have developed GMF that applies a linear kernel to model the latent feature interactions and MLP that uses a non-linear kernel to learn the interaction function from data. \n",

    "A straightforward solution is to let GMF and MLP share the same embedding layer and then combine the outputs of their interaction functions.\n",

    "To provide flexibility to the fused model we want to allow GMF and MLP to learn separate embeddings and combine two models by concatenating their last hidden layer. \n",
